I don't consider myself to be unlucky with meteor, but I did encounter few problems and had sloved them. So, I thought developing the  Digits application would be safter and easier. It prove me wrong on the first day, I immediately encounter my first problem in Digits 1. I could not start my project and display it on Localhost:3000, in the beginning I thought it was just being slow and I have experience the long build time on meteor, so it did not occure to me as a problem. But When 30 minutes passby and it is still running, I started to fear. I tired to exit out and run the commmand again, but after waiting another long period of time, it is still downloading and extracting files. I don't know what to do, I started to backtrack in hope of finding the problem that is causing this. In the end, I questioned the problem to be Intellij, because while I was waiting for the website to build, I went ahead and started the project on Intellij to save some time. Because from previous meteor and Intellij experience, Intellij will takes a long time to load the files for the first time. so, I delete everything on my local environment and restart digtis 1 from sratch and doing everything in order. This solved the problem and I ended up spenting more time when I was trying to save time.
