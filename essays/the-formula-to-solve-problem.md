Does the perfect master plan that can solve every problem in software engineering exist? The question is a "No", but we do have something that is close, they are called "design patterns". Design patterns are guidelines and solutions that solve common problems in software design. They are usually good options if you are uncertain and struggling with how to do something. Because it is safer and more time-saving to use design patterns that are widely tested and proven to work. There are three main types of design patterns: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral which aim at different areas of problem. 


Most of us actually have used some of the design patterns before either in school assignments or in personal work. There are reasons to why instructors want assignments to be done and process in a certain way. Design patterns are just ways and format of doing things, so it is no surprise that I also have done some design patterns. The most obvious design pattern I experienced is the Prototype design pattern when using Javascript. Javascript promotes the style of prototype or actually it is built around the idea of prototype. I can't miss the Observer design pattern, it is impossible to not have contact with some kind of event handler. Software engineering design around interaction, so there is a lot of state changing and reactions to the stage changes. Actually,  in our project to build a fully functional website, I did a lot of design patterns. Factory, Singleton, Template method and MVC to list a few. 


Design patterns are more of a mainstream method and it allows developers to communicate using commonly known terms. Also, it is very important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each design patterns because they are not perfect. But they are very good starting point and you can build from there.
