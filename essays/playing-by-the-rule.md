In our civilized society, everything has standards to maintain order. Sometimes standard may seem like a murder to individual differences and styles and it's true. But standards are especially important if the works are meant to be shared and coding is one of them. Coding standards are created to improve both the sharing and learning experience.
Coding standards should not restrict people from their coding style. So a good coding standard should not limit people to only do things in one way and need a good justification for every rule. For example in ESlint for Javascript, it enforces the use of let and const and avoids the use of var at all cost. At first, it just feels like extra work because knowing when to use const and let required more planning than just spam var to everything. But there is a good justification to do the extra work, the difference in the memory usage in large scale can make a huge impact.
