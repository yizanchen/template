Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
Hard to find information about place to eat on campus, because each of them have their own website. Our solution is to combine all the information together in one place. We will achieve this using meteor and semantic ui. 

Mockup page ideas
We will have names, hour of operation and links to its reviews, menus of all the places on campus. 

Use case ideas
After your 5pm class, you are hungry and looking for a place to eat on campus. You open the app, see all the location on campus and which are open. Then you click on the link of your selected vendor, you will see all the menu items that are avaliable. You will also see the reviews and the location to that place.  

Beyond the basics
We will have coloring coding to indicate whether a place in open, a green hightlight will appear on the links of the place that are open and red light for closed place. We will have a css class that only appear during certain time by setting its condition to a certain timeframe.
