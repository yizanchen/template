I still can remember the time I received my first box of Lego, it took me a good amount time to put it together. It is not long until I tear it back into pieces and start building something on my own. The Lego plant the creator seed in my heart which caused my growing interest in science and creation. I wanted to be a mechanical engineer at first, so I took a circuit class during high school. That is when I got contact to robotics and found out what is more powerful than a bunch of metal, the software that control the metal. 

I want to create something bigger than car, plane and even space satellite, and the answer is computer software. In the modern world, many people can't live without computer software, because it is controlling everything around us. Computer technologies are only so young, we can still do a lot more than what we have, it is the future.

It is terrifying to think what you can do with computer software. It has unlimited possibilities and you can gain control of it by becoming a software engineer. As a software engineer, you learn the master skill of the future. It is very motivating to learn software development because it is going to be the main force pushing the world to the next stage and you are contributing. 

I am very knowledge hunger, so I want to learn everything I find interest in. So right now, I want to learn more in creating automated software that can take input from its own oservation and data. Or in another word, artificial intelligence, it feels so close and yet so far in creating AI. I want to participate in large scale AI program and to truly create "intelligence".
