When I first hear about Meteor, I was both scared and excited.  During the screencast, it sounds very complicated but it also sounds really cool that I can implement server and client. It is one of the few things I learned that I felt like I can use to build something useful with. Even though an initial learning curve was expected, but I was still not prepared enough. 

In the beginning, Meteor appears to be too amazing to be true. You make some calls in command prompt and you get a working webpage with dynamic interaction. During the first week of learning Meteor, we are just doing very simple tasks. But it is very scary when I am copying code without knowing what they mean. The most difficult problem in the first week was getting used to the long building time from Meteor. 

When Digits come along, it actually required you to learn what each code means and do. The hardest part is to keep track of all the imports and indexes. I lost myself inside the dictionary few times during practice WODs because I am not familiar enough to know what each part does.
