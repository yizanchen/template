summary: This was a project I created on my own and was inspired by my friend's homework.

This was a JavaFX project from my friend's ICS class, but I want to do it for fun and learning. I have to create a UI interface that let you select a Pokemon and then the information of the selected Pokemon would show up and you can choose to add that Pokemon to your list.

I am a visual person, so I really like creating JavaFX project because you can see what you did other than console text. The project description tells people to use JFrame to create this project, so I go online and start reading and testing out methods in the class library. In the beginning, everything was a mess, things are just not working together. So, I tried to create a very basic scene with just the window first, and then add more elements and make sure all of them work as I intended then move to more elements.

It was both a fun and educational experience for myself, I am happy with the final product. One of the reasons to why I like Java is the huge amount of resource online that even if you never hear of something before, you can find it and learn about it.
