summary: This project was created for my ICS 314 class as a final project. It is a site for UH student gamers to play together.
---


This was the final project in my programming class and it used everything we learned in that class. As a group of 4, we were assigned to the topic "game buddies", a website that let UH students gamers find other UH students gamers with similar interest. So, we create Warrior Gamers, a place where UH students can create a profile with their gaming interests and game names. All the profiles will be on the Browse page and user can filter and find other gamers with similar interest. Aside from that, we also have a page that displays popular games and ranks them based on the number of students tagged that game in their profile. If students want to meet others in groups, we have the event page where it shows incoming game events in UH campus. All students have the ability to add events and games that are not already in our database.

In the early stage of this project, we had many brainstorm meetings trying to decide what we want and what we should put on the site. Everyone helped each other and everyone did what they can. But each member was assigned a part and my main responsibility is the Game List page. In the process, I learned how to use GitHub project management system to work together with my group. It deepens my knowledge of the materials I learned in class and combined them to create a functional site. Every page is connected and it tests your understanding of the system to make any changes. So, communication is the most important element in working as a group.
